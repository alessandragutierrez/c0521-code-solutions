    <h2>Calculate an estimate of your ROI with Canvas</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <h4>1&period; Making the Decision To Switch</h4>
      <p>
        You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
        determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
        unmatched return on investment&period; Our goal is to give you as
        much information as possible to make this determination one way or
        the other&period; We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas
        application for you to get a feel for the platform as well as
        references to current customers to talk about their experience&period;
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h4>2&period; Interfaces and Community Integration</h4>
      <p>
        Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
        community resources&period; At a minimum&comma; this means porting
        over your fax number&comma; enrolling your payers with our
        clearinghouse&comma; and getting bidirectional lab feeds
        running&period; We&apos;ll also load your preferred specialists and
        imaging centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing
        loops is seamless&period; Finally&comma; if interfaces with health
        information exchanges or other information technology vendors are
        important&comma; we will work with you to determine what we can
        deliver and when&period;
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h4>3&period; Data Migration</h4>
      <p>
        The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
        current data&comma; which we have executed successfully with both
        remotely hosted and on&dash;premise EMR databases&period; Then our
        work begins to import into Canvas&period; Patient demographics and
        information like medications&comma; problems&comma; and allergies
        is relatively straightforward&period; While importing clinical notes
        and documents is more challenging&comma; our team has been able to
        do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of
        EMRS&period;
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h4>4&period; Training and Site Visit</h4>
      <p>
        We will work with you to configure Canvas properly&comma; including
        clinical content&comma; charge schedules&comma; and much more&period;
        Role&dash;based trainings will be done a few weeks prior to
        go&dash;live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical&comma;
        practice management&comma; and billing workflows&period; Either before
        or during go&dash;live&comma; one of our team can visit your practice
        to work side&dash;by&dash;side with you on implementation and
        training&period;
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h4>5&period; Go&dash;Live and Tuning</h4>
      <p>
        Go&dash;live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in
        your practice&period; We will be with you&comma; either in&dash;person
        or remotely depending on your preference&comma; to make sure
        everything goes smoothly&period; There is always fine tuning to do once
        you have a handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt&colon;
        changing clinical microtemplates&comma; setting up new
        automations&comma; modifying practice management settings&comma; and
        more&period; We are here to help with it all&period;
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h4>6&period; Sustained Performance</h4>
      <p>
        All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises
        and provide support over the long term&period; Our Performance
        Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations&comma; you can
        terminate the agreement and receive all payments back&period;
        &lpar;We do not expect this to happen&rpar;&period; For our Standard
        plans&comma; we also offer a MIPS guarantee&colon; if you receive
        a negative adjustment&comma; we will cover it&period; And for
        everyone&comma; we provide unlimited 24&sol;7 support at no
        charge&period; We expect this to be a long&comma; productive
        partnership for us both&period;
