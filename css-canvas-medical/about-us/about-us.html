      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p>
        Why did we enter this crowded field&quest; Because medical records have
        fallen dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality and
        efficiency of health care&period; Clinicians spend far too long at their
        computers&period; Workflows are overly restrictive&period; Valuable
        medical data is left unstructured&period;
      </p>
      <p>
        We are honored&comma; and humbled&comma; when a practice chooses us as
        their technology partner&period; Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes
        art and science &ndash;&ndash; technology can help or hinder this
        craft&period; Working with clinicians across the country&comma; we think
        we have begun to build something that helps&period;

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna
        &ndash;&ndash; a family nurse practitioner &ndash;&ndash; sacrifice
        family time in the evenings to &quot;finish&quot; charting&period;
        It never ended&period;
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrew knew that the answer wasn&apos;t to go out and do it alone&period;
        He started to fill the gaps in his experience&period; Seven practicing
        clinicians formed the clinical advisory board &ndash;&ndash; rather
        than leave practice to work full&dash;time with Canvas&comma; they
        used and reviewed product changes in their practices&period; Our
        Medical Director&comma; Dr&period; Zimmerman&comma; joined when he
        saw the potential of Canvas to help independent practices like his
        practice&comma; Temescal Creek Medicine in Oakland&comma; CA&period;
        Julian joined Canvas after working at the Medicare and seeing the
        failures of current technology to keep up with increasing regulatory
        demands without burdening clinicians&period; Joe and a world class
        group of software developers joined to accelerate our ability to listen
        to clinician feedback and constantly improve the product&period;
      </p>
      <p>
        With Canvas&comma; we created a fundamentally different way of charting
        that completely eliminates the need for menus and pop&dash;ups&period;
        The name of the company descrives the charting experience &ndash;&ndash;
        it feels like a blank canvas where you can tell the patient&apos;s story
        and seamlessly complete notes&comma; orders&comma; and chart review on
        a single&comma; unified screen&period; With seamlessly integrated
        population health&comma; billing&comma; and practice management&comma;
        Canvas is a reimagined platform for the modern primary care
        practice&period;
